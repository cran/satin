\title{
Anomalies of a satin object
}
\description{
This function returns ocean data anomalies of a satin object.  Anomalies are calculated subtracting a conforming average satin object.
}
\usage{
anomaly(X, Y)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
 a satin object obtained with \code{\link{satinMean}} for which anomalies are to be calculated. It must have identifying \code{labels} in the slot \code{attribs}.
}
  \item{Y}{
 also a satin object returned by \code{\link{satinMean}} with the means to be subtracted from \code{X}. It must have the same \code{labels} as \code{X}.
}
}
\details{
The anomalies of a satin object represent, for every pixel, the values above and below a reference average.  A typical example can be monthly sea surface temperature anomalies for various years.  These are calculated subtracting the corresponding average month for the whole period (see example below).

In principle, anomalies can be calculated for other ocean variables and time periods, but is up to the user to determine if that makes sense.  For example, let say that \code{Z} is a satin object with daily chlorophyll-a concentration data for several years.  In order to calculate quarterly anomalies, we will need first to obtain \code{X <- satinMean(Z, "\%Y-\%qtr")} and \code{Y <- satinMean(Z, "\%qtr")}.
}
\value{
 An object of  class \code{"satin"} (see \code{\link{satin-class}} for details) where the third dimension in the data array accomodates the calculated anomalies.  An extra element (\code{labels}) is included in the slot \code{attribs} to identify the time period of the anomalies.
